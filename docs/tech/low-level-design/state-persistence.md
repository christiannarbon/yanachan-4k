# State persistence

`backend/internal/state/state.go`

Two JSON files in one directory. That is the entire persistence layer.

| File | Holds | Corrupt file behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settings.json` | teams, orgs, limit, window override, view flags | startup error |
| `session.json` | auth mode, login, token, created stamp | ignored, user signs in again |

The asymmetry is deliberate. A corrupt session costs a sign-in; a corrupt
settings file means somebody's followed teams are about to be silently replaced
with defaults, and failing loudly is the kinder outcome.

## The store

```go
type Store struct {
    mu           sync.RWMutex
    settingsPath string
    sessionPath  string
    settings     Settings
    session      *Session
}
```

Everything goes through the mutex, and `Session()` returns a **copy** — a caller
holding a pointer into the store could otherwise mutate the token in place. That
is what `TestSessionReturnsCopy` is for.

## File modes

The directory is created `0700` and then `Chmod`ed to `0700` explicitly, because
`MkdirAll` only applies the mode to directories it actually creates: a state
directory that already existed — the pre-rename one, or a path handed in through
`GHDASH_STATE_DIR` — keeps whatever it had, which may well be world-readable.
The chmod is defence in depth and its failure is not worth aborting over.

Both files are written `0600`. `TestPersistedFilesAreOwnerOnly` asserts it.

## Atomic writes

Write to a temp file in the same directory, then `rename` over the target. A
crash mid-write leaves either the old file or the new one, never half of either.
`TestSaveLeavesNoTempFile` checks the temp file does not survive a successful
write.

## Normalization

`normalize` runs on every load and every save, so an out-of-range value is
**corrected rather than rejected**:

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| `Limit` | outside 1–100 → the configured default |
| `WindowHours` | outside 0–720 (`MaxWindowHours`) → 0, the business-day rule |
| `Teams`, `Orgs` | trimmed, case-insensitively deduped, truncated to `MaxRefs` (200) |

Shape validation is separate and lives in the API handler, where it can return a
400 with a message worth reading: a team must contain a slash, an org must not.

`MaxWindowHours` is 30 days. Past roughly 292 years the hours-to-`Duration`
multiplication overflows outright, and nothing here is useful at that range.

## Where the directory is

`config.defaultStateDir()`:

1. `<UserConfigDir>/yana-chan-4k` if it exists.
2. Otherwise `<UserConfigDir>/github-dashboarder` if *that* exists — the
   pre-rename directory.
3. Otherwise `<UserConfigDir>/yana-chan-4k`, which will be created.

The fallback matters because the expensive thing to lose is the session: losing
it means authenticating again. Once the new directory exists it always wins, so
this is a one-way migration that never runs twice.

`GHDASH_STATE_DIR` overrides all of it, and is what the container and the pod
set (`/data`).

## Sign-out

`ClearSession` removes `session.json` and drops the in-memory copy.
`settings.json` is untouched — the teams you follow are not a secret and are not
worth making you re-enter.
