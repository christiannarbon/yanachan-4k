# Authentication

Three paths, all opt-in. Whichever you pick, the dashboard asks before it acts.

## 1. Local gh CLI session

On start the backend checks whether `gh` is on `PATH` and whether it is logged
in. It does **not** read the token to do that. The first screen reports what it
found and asks for approval; only when you approve does the backend run
`gh auth token` and use the result for GitHub calls.

This is the path to use on your own laptop. Nothing to configure.

Set `GHDASH_ALLOW_GH_CLI=false` to remove the option entirely — appropriate when
the app is running somewhere it should never inherit an ambient session.

## 2. OAuth device flow

Set `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` to an OAuth app with the device flow enabled:

```sh
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Iv1.xxxxxxxxxxxx make run
```

GitHub shows a code, you enter it in your browser, the backend polls until you
approve. There is no client secret and no callback URL, so the flow behaves the
same on a laptop, inside Docker and behind a port-forward.

Scopes requested: `repo read:org`.

If `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` is unset, the backend says so in its startup log and the
option is not offered.

## 3. Token from the environment

If `GH_TOKEN` is present, the app offers it as an option — still behind an
approval click. This is how the Docker and Kubernetes targets forward a local
`gh` session into a container, since `gh` is not installed in the image.

`GHDASH_GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` are also read, in that order of
preference: `GHDASH_GITHUB_TOKEN`, then `GH_TOKEN`, then `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Where the token goes

The token is written to `session.json` in the state directory with `0600`
permissions and is sent only to `api.github.com`. It is never returned to the
browser — there is a test that asserts exactly that.

**Sign out** in the settings dialog deletes the file.

## There is no login

The token lives on the server and the server has no user accounts, so anything
that can reach the port is already authenticated. That is why the app binds to
`127.0.0.1` by default and refuses to answer to a `Host` header it does not
recognise:

```sh
GHDASH_ALLOWED_HOSTS=dash.example.internal make run
```

The reasoning behind that, and the two other guards next to it, is in
[the security model](../tech/architecture/security.md). The short version: do
not put this on a public address without an authenticating proxy in front of it.
